# Propagating-ultrafast-lasers-pulses
Parts of my master work on the propagation of femtosecond laser pulses in diffractive and refractive media.
This reposetory is avilable to any one who needs exampels on the propogation of electromagnetic waves.
NOTE: this work is aimed for general use, in the sense that any pulse duration should work, my main focus is on the femtosecond (10^-15 sec) time scale. If you have some wave dynamics backgoround you know that any laser pulse is composed of some constituent sinusoidal waves with different frequencies and (maybe) different amplitudes, and so, if you can crarfully write down the different frequancies this should work for you as well. 

In order to use all the functions in this repository you will need OSLO by Lambda research (there is a free EDU version but some features might not work), OSLO is used to simulate an optical setup and to propagate the beam. Matlab is the second part, which is used for processing the output obtained by OSLO as well as using FFT to find the complete spatio-temporal electric field.
